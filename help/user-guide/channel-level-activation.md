# Channel Level Activation - Single Event Playback {#channel-level-activation-single-event-playback}

Using Channel Level Activation covers the following topics:

* Overview
* Using Channel Level Activation as a Single Event Playback

## Overview {#overview}

***Channel Level Activation*** allows the channels to switch after a particluar set schedule. The single event channel replaces the main channel after a set schedule and plays for a particular time, until the main channel plays its content again.

The following example provides a solution by focusing on the following key terms:

* a ***main sequence channel*** for the global sequence
* a ***single event channel*** that runs only once at a set time
* a ***set schedule and priority*** for the single playback event that occurs inside the main sequence channel

## Using Channel Level Activation {#using-channel-level-activation}

The following section explains the creation of a single event playback inside a channel for an AEM Screens project.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start implementing this functionality, please make sure you have the following prerequisites ready to start implementing channel level activation:

* Create an AEM Screens project, in this example, **Channel Level Activation**

* Create a channel as **MainAdChannel** under **Channels** folder

* Create another channel as **TargetedSinglePlay** under **Channels** folder

* Add relevant assets to both the channels

The following image shows the **Channel Level Activation** project with **MainAdChannel** and **TargetedSinglePlay** channels in **Channels** folder.

### Implementation {#implementation}

Implementing Channel Level Activation in an AEM Screens project involves three major tasks:

1. **Setting up Project taxonomy including Channels, Locations, and Displays**
1. **Assigning Channels to Display**
1. **Setting up a Schedule and Priority**

Follow the steps below to implement the functionality:

1. **Create a Location**

   Navigate to your **Locations** folder in your AEM Screens project and create a location as **Region**.

   >To learn how to create a location, please refer to **[Creating and Managing Locations](managing-locations.md)**.

1. **Create Display under Location**

    1. Navigate to **Channel Level Activation** > **Locations** > **Region**.
    1. Select **Region** and click **+ Create** from the action bar.
    1. Select **Display** from the wizard and create a display titled as **RegionDisplay.**

   ![screen_shot_2018-11-27at112216am](assets/screen_shot_2018-11-27at112216am.png)

1. **Assign Channels to Display**

   For **MainAdChannel:**

    1. Navigate to **Channel Level Activation** > **Locations** > **Region** > **RegionDisplay** and click **Assign Channel** from the action bar.
    1. **Channel Assignment** dialog box opens.
    1. Select **Reference Channel**.. by path.
    1. Select the **Channel Path** as **Channel Level Activation** --&gt; ***Channels*** --&gt; ***MainAdChannel***.

   Similarly, assign channel **TargetedSinglePlay** for display**:

    1. Navigate to **Channel Level Activation** --&gt; **Locations** --&gt; **Region** --&gt; **RegionDisplay** and click **Assign Channel** from the action bar.
    1. **Channel Assignment** dialog box opens.
    1. Select **Reference Channel**.. by path.
    1. Select the **Channel Path** as **Channel Level Activation*** --&gt; ***Channels*** --&gt; ***TargetedSinglePlay***.

    1. Set the **Priority** as **2**.
    1. Select the **Supported Events** as **Initial Load**, **Idle Screen** and **Timer**, *as shown in the figure below.
    1. Choose the date in **active from** as November 27, 2018 11:59 pm and in **active until** as November 28, 2018 12:05 am.
    1. Click **Save**.

## Viewing the Results {#viewing-the-results}

Once you have the set up for channels and display complete, please launch the AEM Screens player to view the content.

The player displays the content of **MainAdChannel** and exactly at 11:59 pm (as set in the schedule), the **TargetedSinglePlay** channel will display its content until 12:05 am and then the **MainAdChannel** will resume playing its content again.
