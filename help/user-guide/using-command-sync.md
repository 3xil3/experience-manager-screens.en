# Using Command Sync {#using-command-sync}

The following page describes how to use Command Sync. Coomand Sync allows synchronized playback across different players. The players can be playing different content but each asset needs to have the same duration.

## Overview {#overview}

Digital signage solutions need to support video walls and synchronized playback to support scenarios like New Year countdowns or large video sliced up to play across multiple screens and this is where Content Sync comes into play.

To use Content Sync, one player acts as a *master* and send command and all the other players act as *clients* and play when they receive the command. The *master* sends a command to all registered clients when it is about to start playback of an item. The payload of this can be the index of the item to be played and/or the outer html of the element to be played.
