## Adding a Transition Component {#adding-transition}

Follow the steps below to add a transition component to your AEM Screens project:

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Prerequisites**
> Create an AEM Screens project **TestProject** 
with a channel **TestTransition**. Additionally, set up a location and a display to view the 
 output.

1. Navigate to the Channel **TestTransition** and click **Edit** from the action bar.

   

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **TestTransition** channel already has few assets (images and videos) in it. For example, the **TestTransition** channel includes five images and a video, as shown below:

   

1. Drag and drop the **Transition** component to your editor.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   >By default, the transition component is set to Type as **Normal** with **Duration** set to *600 ms*.

   
   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Before you add the transition to your assets in your channel, make sure:
       You do not add transition before the first asset in the sequential channel. The first item in your channel must be an asset and not a transition.
