# Inventory Driven Channel{#inventory-driven-channel}

## Getting Started with Inventory Driven Channels {#getting-started-with-inventory-driven-channels}

This section describes a use case example that emphasizes on creating and managing a data driven asset change using Google Sheets.

### Preconditions {#preconditions}

Before you start this use case, make sure you understand how to:

* **[Create and Manage Channels](managing-channels.md)**
* **[Create and Manage Locations](managing-locations.md)**
* **[Create and Manage Schedules](managing-schedules.md)**
* **[Device Registration](device-registration.md)**

### Primary Actors {#primary-actors}

Content Authors

### Terminolgies {#terminolgies}

Follow the terms below that play a significant role in understanding and setting up the project in the different use cases:

**Activity** Activity refers to the category.

**Area** Project main

**Audience** Location of the data

**Brand** Brand refers

**Segment** Segment refers to a container of assets that you are trying to target.

### Basic Flow: Setting up the Project {#basic-flow-setting-up-the-project}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Prerequisite:**
>
>Before you dive deep into details of setting up and using data driven asset change in your project, make sure you create an AEM Screens project with a sequence channel. For demo purposes, project titled **DataDrivenAsset** is created and sequence channels titled **DataDrivenRestaurant**, **DataDrivenTextOverlay**, **DataDrivenWeather**, and **DataDrivenRetail** are added to the project, as shown in the figure below.
>
>Creating four different channels is only for demonstration purposes and to showcase four different use cases in different channels. If you want to follow only one use case as your requirement, please feel free to create only one sequence channel.

![screen_shot_2019-05-01at42043pm](assets/screen_shot_2019-05-01at42043pm.png)

Follow the sections below to create a sample project on creating and managing a data driven asset change using Google Sheets in an AEM Screens project:

## Step 1: Setting up Database {#step-setting-up-database}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Google Sheets is used in the following example database system from where the values are fetched and is solely for educational purposes. Adobe does not endorse using Google Sheets for production environments.
>
>For more information, refer to [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) in Google documentation.

1. Log in to Google Docs.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You must have an account in Google Drive before you create a new Google Sheet.

1. Start a new blank spreadsheet. Add content to your google sheet and save it. For demo purposes, the Google Sheet is named as **ContextHubDemo**.
1. Click **Share** on the top right corner of the Google Sheet to open **Share with Others** dialog box. Click **Advanced** option and change the settings to **On - Anyone with the link**, as shown in the figure below.

   This step allows you to access values in the google sheet.

   ![screen_shot_2019-04-22at115829am](assets/screen_shot_2019-04-22at115829am.png)

1. When you click **Save** from the preceding step, you will get the link for the Google Sheet. Save the click for future references and click **Done**.

   ![screen_shot_2019-04-22at120242pm](assets/screen_shot_2019-04-22at120242pm.png)

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Google Sheets is used in the following example for educational purposes. Adobe does not endorse using Google Sheets for production environments.

## Step 2: Enabling the Google Sheets REST APIs {#step-enabling-the-google-sheets-rest-apis}

Once you have setup your Google Sheet, you have to enable the Google Sheet REST API to access the values.

To learn in how to enable the REST APIs for Google Sheets, refer to Google APIs documentation.

1. Navigate to [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Click **CREATE** to create a new project.

   ![screen_shot_2019-04-22at125028pm](assets/screen_shot_2019-04-22at125028pm.png)

1. Enter the **Project Name** as **AssetChange** and click **CREATE**.
1. Once you have created the project to need to set up the API Key. Click **Create credentials** and select **API key **to generate API key for your project. Save the API key for future references.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This demo project uses the free Google API key. You may want to refer to pricing and restriction on Google's website **Get API Key** for more information.

### Verifying the Setup of Google Sheets {#verifying-the-setup-of-google-sheets}

```
Verify the data in your Google Sheets using the steps below
```

[https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/](https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/)&lt;your sheet id&gt;/values/Sheet1?key=&lt;your API key&gt;

For example:

If the** Google Sheets** link is *as below:*

`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ksd125lAsDd0_wnMWgLNUiEpKOUPaok7xfh64s-VO7M/edit?usp=sharing`, then the

**Sheet Id** is: `1Ksd125lAsDd0_wnMWgLNUiEpKOUPaok7xfh64s-VO7M`

**API Key** is: `AIzaSyAfoANOeLkFCCyohjL8cOdJLhrhGefqEy8`

Adding both the values in the syntax above:

`https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/1Ksd125lAsDd0_wnMWgLNUiEpKOUPaok7xfh64s-VO7M/values/Sheet1?key=AIzaSyAfoANOeLkFCCyohjL8cOdJLhrhGefqEy8`

You should now be able to view your data in the sheet.

## Step 2: Configuring AEM to fetch the content of the Google Sheets {#step-configuring-aem-to-fetch-the-content-of-the-google-sheets}

The following section describes how to configure Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to fetch content from the Google Sheets.

1. Navigate to your AEM instance and click the tools icon from left sidebar. Click **Sites** --&gt; **ContextHub**, as shown in the figure below.

   ![screen_shot_2019-04-22at53222pm](assets/screen_shot_2019-04-22at53222pm.png)

1. **Create a new ContextHub Store Configuration**

    1. Navigate to **global** &gt; **default** &gt; **ContextHub Configuration**.

    1. Click** Create &gt; Configuration Cotainer **and enter the title as** ContextHubDemo**.

    1. **Navigate** to **ContextHubDemo** &gt; **ContentHub Store Configuration...** to open the **Configure wizard**
    1. Enter the **Title** as **Google Sheets**, **Store Name** as **googlesheets**, and **Store Type** as **contexthub.generic-jsonp**
    1. Click **Next**
    1. Enter your specific json configuration. For example, you can use the following json for demo purposes.
    1. Click **Save**.

   ```
   {
     "service": {
       "host": "sheets.googleapis.com",
       "port": 80,
       "path": "/v4/spreadsheets/<your sheet it>/values/Sheet1",
       "jsonp": false,
       "secure": true,
       "params": {
         "key": "<your API key>"
       }
     },
     "pollInterval": 3000
   }
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >In the above sample code, **pollInterval** defines the frequency at which the values are refreshed (in ms).
   >
   >
   >Replace the code with your *&lt;Sheet ID&gt;* and *&lt;API Key&gt;*, that you fetched from **Step 1: Setting up Database.**

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >If you create your Google Sheets store configurations outside of the legacy folder (for instance in your own project folder), then targeting will not work out of the box.
   >
   >
   >In case, you want to configure the Google Sheets store configurations outside the global legacy folder, then you should must set the **Store Name** as **segmentation** and **Store Type** as **aem.segmentation**. Additionally, you have to skip the process of defining the json as defined above.
