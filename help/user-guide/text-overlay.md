>The **Text Overlay** feature is only available, if you have installed AEM 6.3 Feature Pack 5 or AEM 6.4 Feature Pack 3.

## Overview {#overview}

Text Overlay is a feature available in AEM Screens that allows you to create a compelling experience in a Sequence Channel by providing a title or a description overlaid on top of an image.

To learn how to create your own custom component, please refer to **Extending an AEM Screens Component**.

This section only showcases how to use and leverage the poster component in an AEM Screens project and use it as text overlay in one of your sequence channels.

## Using Text Overlay {#using-text-overlay}

The following section describes the use of text overlay in an AEM Screens project.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start implementing this functionality, please make sure you have set up a project as a prerequisite to start implementing text overlay. For example,

* Create an AEM Screens project (in this example, **TextOverlayDemo**)

* Create a sequence channel titled as **TextSample** under **Channels** folder

* Add content to your **TextSample** Channel

The following image shows the **TextOverlayDemo** project with **TextSample** channel in **Channels** folder.

![text](assets/text.gif)

You can add a text to the text box and add typographical emphasis such as bold, italics, underline, and so on.

**Color Variant** This option allows the text to be either Dark (text in black color) or Light (text in white color).

**Sizing & positioning** This option allows the user to align the text horizontally or vertically or additionally use fine-grained tools for text alignment.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To properly use fine-grained tools, be sure to identify the correct position in pixels using (px) as a suffix, for example 200px. The result of this expression will be 200 pixels from start point.
