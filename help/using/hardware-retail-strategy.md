# Hardware Content Strategy {#hardware-content}

Continuation from content strategy: where and how would content be most impactful? 

[ADOBE @JIM TO EXPAND]
Questions and considerations:
Retail layout should be aligned with content strategy 
Will interactions (i.e. touchscreen, motion detection) be needed? 
What is the purpose of the digital signage? Is it for product configuration? Is it wayfinding? Does it show advertisements? 
Connection and network wiring set up
How often will the computers and connection be on? Off? 
Does the fixture design support accessibility?
Are multiple devices required for one display?  (Multi, zones, extra large boards, etc.) 
Other environmental considerations such as brightness, temperature, and seasonality.
