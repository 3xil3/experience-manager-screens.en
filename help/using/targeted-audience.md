## AEM Implementors {#aem-implementors}
AEM Implementors are responsible for performing development and integration tasks to develop the user experience, custom templates, and back-end integrations for AEM.

Custom features required to address end-customer UX (User Experience) parameters are also captured and delivered through this process.

AEM Implementors will typically deploy custom functionality in phases over time to locations. For example, they might first establish support for playback of basic looped video or static graphic content. The next phase might include enabling the ability to support playback of  localized content through dynamic templates and metadata tags, with additional phases incorporating support for interactive elements via touch screens, sensors, dynamic triggers, and so on.
