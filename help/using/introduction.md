# Introduction to AEM Screens {#introduction}

**AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) Screens** is a Digital Signage Solution that allows you to publish dynamic and interactive digital experiences and interactions involving different types of screens in conjunction with a comprehensive digital marketing platform.

**AEM Screens** is a powerful web-based solution that helps to to expand customer interaction and deliver unified and useful brand experiences into physical venues such as stores, hotels, banks, healthcare and educational institutions, and many more â€“ from the same AEM platform.

AEM Screens allows you to create:

* **dedicated digital menu boards**
* **product recommenders**
* **background lifestyle imagery**

Additionally, Screens provide many unique applications for customers and employees based on the domain where these are deployed, such as:

* **interactive displays**
* **wayfinding**
* **branding**
* **adding ambience to your environment**

Creating and managing an application using AEM Screens is simple and intuitive. An application hosts web pages built for AEM Screens by customers or implementation partners. *Locations* manage pre-defined hierarchy and contains displays. Each *display* has a dashboard that shows different devices and screens attached. Content for AEM Screens is managed in *channels*. *AEM Screens Player* renders content present within channels onto displays.

## AEM Sites versus AEM Screens {#aem-sites-screens}

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your implementation team has experience working with AEM Sites applications, it is important to understand the difference between AEM Sites and AEM Screens.

AEM Screens provides a framework to deploy content to physical devices. Content is assigned to Channels in Screens, which can contain media content or touch screen applications. Within this framework, an AEM Site application could be delivered as content through a Channel.

Regardless of the complexity of the Site application, it will not override the entities defined in AEM Screens. The Channels and Displays defined in AEM Screens effectively provide a container to deliver the Site application to physical devices.

Before being dropped into a Channel in Screens, an AEM Site must be formatted for use at the dimensions of the display device it is intended for.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Many AEM Sites components are not compatible with AEM Screens. AEM Screens comes with many of its own out-of-the-box components allowing you to build digital experiences without requiring customization. If project requirements allow, use built-in AEM Screens functionality where possible.
