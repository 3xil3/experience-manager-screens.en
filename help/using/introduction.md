# Introduction to AEM Screens {#introduction}

**AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) Screens** is a Digital Signage Solution that allows you to publish dynamic and interactive digital experiences and interactions involving different types of screens in conjunction with a comprehensive digital marketing platform.

**AEM Screens** is a powerful web-based solution that allows you to create dedicated digital menu boards, product recommenders, background lifestyle imagery to expand customer interaction and deliver unified and useful brand experiences into physical venues, such as stores, hotels, banks, healthcare and educational institutions, and many more â€“ from the same AEM platform. Screens provide many unique applications such as interactive displays, wayfinding, branding, and adding ambience to your environment for customers and employees based on the domain where these are deployed.

Creating and managing an application using AEM Screens is simple and intuitive. An application hosts web pages built for AEM Screens by customers or implementation partners. Locations manage pre-defined hierarchy and contains displays. Each display has a dashboard that shows different devices and screens attached. Content for AEM Screens is managed in channels. AEM Screens Player renders content present within channels onto displays.

## Personas {#personas}

Starting a new digital signage experience requires a cohesion of roles before it is ready for consumption. 

The following roles provide a starting point for creating a new Screens project:

### Author {#author}

An AEM Screens Author is responsible for creating and managing a user experience using the available components in AEM Screens. The author creates and reviews the content and provides an easy to use graphical user interface by configuring, deploying, and integrating the available segments of AEM Screens.

An author typically begins the Screens project by creating a simple project, creating channels, adding components and assets to the channel, scheduling, creating locations and displays, followed by assigning channels to the displays. An author creates channels from the given sequences and knows the campaign audience and the desired focus. Thus, an AEM Screens author creates and orchestrates the end user experience by creating different channels and assigning sequences into timed channel experience.

### Developer {#developer}

An AEM Screens Developer is responsible for designing and building an interactive system. Basically, a developer creates an application and creates content sequences or to develop apps or sequences which may be utilized for multiple channels.

A developer creates applications and components, works on API integrations and plugin extensions, builds player extensions, integrates analytics and performs logging operations.

### System Administrator {#administrator}

An AEM Screens Administrator or the Technician is responsible for installation of the physical devices, setting up the hardware, and configuring the Screens player for initial use. In some organizations, the role may expand to a system administrator who is responsible for assigning accounts, scheduling test sessions before deployment or may even be running tests for newly created channels or storing configurations. 

An Administrator is responsible for installation and configuration, monitoring (involving tasks related to device dashboard, taking screenshots, updating firmware, and checking heartbeat), and troubleshooting or collecting logs.
