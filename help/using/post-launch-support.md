# Post Launch Support {#post-launch-support}

IMPORTANT!
Post launch support must not be overlooked in the early stage. 

Ensuring sites receive adequate support from your hardware vendor is crucial for their business operations. The A/V integrator should work closely with business stakeholders and identify the requirements needed from different aspects.
For example, requirements such as remote device management, support center availability, and on-site technician support should be discussed and analyzed. Device management, including warranty support and spare device storage, should also be brought up. 
[Direct from PPT] To prepare for long term success, it is paramount to establish a Day 2 Service Level Agreement (SLA) in partnership with the AV Integrator. The SLA should detail all post-deployment support services in order to help accurately set client expectations.

[CALLOUT - Direct from PPT] 
Define operational parameters early to be included in operational budgets as well as aligning the responsibilities with the AEM implementor and AV Integrator. 
Is the deployment an Advertising Network with many stakeholders tied to a monetized network?  This may dictate much shorter resolution timeframes compared to a Corporate Communications network.  
Is the application highly visible to the end client’s executive leadership? Sites with high visibility may merit different treatments. 
Is the application critical to business operations such as menu-boards in fast-food chains? In these cases, the end-client may require on-site resolutions with very short response times, as well as redundancy in playback hardware.

Service-level agreements
A/V Intergrator should be consulting and making recommendation

Questions to consider:
Who will be the main point of contact for support? 
Who will be responding to support requests? 
Which of your retail locations require 24/7 monitoring?
Are the displays an integral part of your business? (i.e. car configurator, sales alerts)
