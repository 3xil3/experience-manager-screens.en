# About this Guide {#about-guide}

The AEM Screens Best Practices Guide intends to provide guidance on how to successfully plan and execute an AEM Screens project.

The AEM Screens is a new extension to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Because the tools are new and their potential applications varied, it is critical to identify important considerations and common risk factors involved in development and deployment of AEM Screens.

This guide not only provides a comprehensive insight and practical advice to imagine, design and bring intentional customer experiences into your digital signage implementation but also how to create a positive impact on your business using some of the best practices followed while deploying a digital signage project in AEM Screens.
