# About this Guide {#about-guide}

The AEM Screens Best Practices Guide intends to provide guidance on how to successfully plan and execute an AEM Screens project.

The AEM Screens is a new extension to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Because the tools are new and their potential applications varied, it is critical to identify important considerations and common risk factors involved in development and deployment of AEM Screens. This Guide intends to help you successfully create, deploy, and manage an AEM Screens Project.
