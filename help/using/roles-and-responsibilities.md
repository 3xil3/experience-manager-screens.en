# Defining Roles and Responsibilities {#project-roles-responsibilities}

One of the key recommendations for any project is establishing the roles and responsibilities as early as possible. This is especially true for an AEM Screens project as it has many moving parts and requires collaboration from different parties. 
Below is a list of the main roles involved in a typical AEM Screens Project: 

A/V IntegratorThe A/V Integrator is the Hardware Vendor/Partner. This is the party that deals with retail design and site preparation, including hardware acquisition, configuration, and deployment. It is typically a contracted 3rd party who has access to a Network Operations Center (NOC - will be discussed later). In many cases, the A/V Integrator is the project owner due to its continuous involvement post-launch.
AEM Screens ImplementorThe AEM Screens Implementor is responsible for the project design and development of AEM Screens application software. Typically, quality assurance, environment configuration, and user training will also be handled by the implementation team. If the Implementor is not in-house, additional user enablement will be required after the project handoff. 
The AEM Implementor could be the following: 
Adobe Consulting Services
AEM Solution Partner
Internal Business IT or Development Team

[Call Out Staffing Metrics] A typical AEM Screens Implementor team would consist of a project manager, two to three AEM Screens developers, a UX designer with digital display experiences, and a QA specialist.  
Business StrategyThe Business Strategy represents the decision makers at the company. This role is heavily involved in the discovery and requirements stages and is the main driver of the project. They are the ones defining requirements and setting up KPI metrics.
