# Prototypes {#prototypes}

During UX design and prototyping phase, consider:

* **Analytics**: based on the interactions, what will be tracked and how?
* **Data**: what data is being used to generate these interactions?
* **Request input**: from the client about the composition of the user interface as early as possible.
* **Development team review**: the proposed UX design, so they can work out a rough plan for implementation and identify possible problems before beginning development work. Both parties should approve the UX design before development work begins.

>[!NOTE]
>
> During the UX design phase, confirm that the UI design can be adequately supported by the data extracted.
> For example, it is likely that not all decision makers are familiar with the data structure of their product database. They may choose descriptors on their UX solution that are not primary fields in the data layer. Identifying early where manipulation of the data may be necessary and communicating it to the client will prevent misunderstandings later. If the client decides to expand or alter the UI labelling after development has begun, more effort will be required to accommodate the changes.
