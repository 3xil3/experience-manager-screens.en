# Vendor Engagement {#vendor-engagement}

In this activity, it is important to identify all the key vendors required in assembling and delivering the network as well as any partner dependencies:

* Identify vendors for all hardware including displays, player PC's, mounts and related peripherals.

* Define capabilities and tasks for each vendor as it relates to the product category they support.

* Confirm delivery *leadtimes* for all deliveribles and create a deployment plan that accomodates for all leadtimes working backwards from the desired install date(s) of the first required installations.

By completing all the previous steps, we should now have a comprehensive *Day 1* Deployment Plan ready to execute.

1. What are the terms of Service level agreement?

1. What is Global coverage?

1. Is it 24 hour support?

1. How will the devices be managed?

1. What are the active monitoring and warning systems?
