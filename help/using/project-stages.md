# Overview on Project Stages {#project-stages-overview}

To support a successful Digital Signage deployment, it is customary to segment the project into 3 stages.  These stages are commonly referred to as **Days**. These are not literal days but designations for each major stage of the project.

1. The first stage is referred to as *Day Zero*. This stage includes all pre-sales and discovery efforts required to fully define project scope.

1. The second stage, *Day One*, refers to all activities included in the deployment effort.

1. The third and final stage *Day Two* refers to all ongoing operations and support elements as part of the total solution.

>[!NOTE]
>
> While this guide puts emphasis primarily on *Day One* and *Day Two*, attention to all three stages is necessary to execute a successful digital signage project.
Follow an additional video on **[Project Management and Deployment](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/screens/using/project-management-and-deployment.html)** to learn about project pre-production, project initiation, and project progression.

The chart below lists common activities under each stage.
It is highly recommended to establish roles and responsibilities early in each stage as the project evolves from concept to live deployment.
