# Testing and Quality Assurance {#testing-quality}


As we get closer to actual deployment of the digital signage network, we should create a Test and QA Plan that addresses every element of the network including all hardware components, all software components and all networking components.
In the phase, entire test systems should be built and fully tested.

A checklist should be created which identifies all the previously defined KPI's and measured the deliverable against them.
This would include:

1) Mechanical considerations for display mounting, player mounting, ventilation, peripheral attachements, cable management and device networking.
2) Software considerations for device registration, media publishing, playback and any previously defined database dependencies

This phase should also be used as a tool for creating an install and user guide which can later be shipped with the equipment and kept on site for future reference.
