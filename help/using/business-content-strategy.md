# Business Content Strategy {#business-content}

Content is a major factor in driving engagement, and in the pre-sales phase it’s important to define a Content Strategy that considers how the application will leverage Software, Hardware and Connectivity resources to successfully deliver the intended value to your client’s customers. 
A well-defined content strategy sets a path to create, distribute, and track the usage of content in relation to the buyer’s journey and the marketing touch points in the sales funnel. Getting the right message to the right customer at the right time is crucial. Consider how the Screens application can help to achieve this and determine KPIs to help measure the success of the application in delivering that content.
Questions that should be answered when building a content strategy: 
Who is the target audience? 
What content needs to be shown to them?
Where will content be most impactful?
When is the ideal time to engage the audience? 
Who will create the content? 
Why should the target audience care about the content? 
What problems is the content helping them solve? (For example, does the Screens application help a customer find the most suitable shoes to wear for extreme mountain climbing? or the perfect appliance for their new home?)
How is the customer interact with the application? In other words, what is the user experience like?
What is your update and upgrade strategy? How often will new content be needed?

CALL OUT (Is this too big for a call out?) When it comes to best practices, it cannot be stressed enough how important it is during the pre-sales stage to begin asking questions regarding no only what content will be shared, but where the content data currently resides and how it will be brought into the Screens project.
Dig deeper into content during implementation, but establish up front what data is available and in what format.
Things to consider regarding content data include:
Where is the content coming from?
Is it up-to-date, accurate, and a source of truth or is it prone to inconsistencies and errors?
Is there an existing integration that can be used for collecting data? Is there a data feed and is it reliable?
In what format is the data?
Is all of the data present? If not, what data is missing and where can it be found?
How often is the data being added to or updated?
