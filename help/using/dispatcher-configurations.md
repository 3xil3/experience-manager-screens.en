# Dispatcher Configurations {#dispatcher-configurations}

Dispatcher is Adobe Experience Manager's caching and/or load balancing tool. Using AEM's Dispatcher also helps to protect your AEM server from attack. Therefore, you can increase the security of your AEM instance by using the Dispatcher in conjunction with an enterprise-class web server.

Refer to **[Dispatcher Configurations for AEM Screens](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/screens/using/dispatcher-configurations-aem-screens.html)** that highlights guidelines for configuring dispatcher for an AEM Screens project.
