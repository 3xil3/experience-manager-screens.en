# Data Triggers {#data-triggers}

There are two main types of data triggers:

* **Local Data Triggers**: These data triggers are local on the device. For example, if you touched the screen, a sensor is activated that triggers local data asset or channel switch.
* **Remote Data Triggers**: This involved data triggered channel switch or an asset switch based on values returned by a Web Service API
