Based on the information gathered during Day Zero, confirm the following information before beginning development:

* What is the orientation, dimensions, and resolution of the screens being used?

* How many screens are being installed per location, and in what configuration?

* Will there be vertical or horizontal tiled displays?

* What software and operating system must be installed on display devices?

* Will an internet connection be required on players to synchronize the screens with AEM servers?

* When will content on players be updated?

>It is also important to validate the specifications for the hardware selected to ensure it can support the application being developed. For example, if the application is intended to run five HD videos at once, will the hardware support it?
