# Transition to Platform {#transition-platform}

As our project has progressed from a strategic vision to a wireframed reality, we should now start preparing for the tasks necessary to actually create a Screens project in AEM that we can deploy. This will include the mapping of platform-specific requirements to lossely defined requirements in the prototyping phase.
Examples would include how and when to use Experience Fragments for creating content groupings, Content Fragments for creating text variations, Context Hub for creating external data stores, OSGI services for network alerts, Asset Link for Creative Cloud sourcing, Network Folders for Asset allocation, Text overlay for realtime data and Workflows for automated content edits.
In this phase, it is important to review all the required activies that will require attention regardless of whether it is activites designed for human intervention and machine intervention.
We should also review all pre-defined activities as candidates for automation in this phase.
